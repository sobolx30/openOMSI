# Modding beyond OMSI 2

openOMSI reads OMSI 2 content as it is: a bus, a map or an object made for OMSI 2 works
without changes. It also lifts limits OMSI 2 put on modders. Everything on this page is an
addition. A file that uses it still loads in OMSI 2, which ignores what it does not know.

## Interior lights: more than four per mesh

OMSI 2 lights a mesh with at most four `[interiorlight]` lamps, the four numbers of its
`[illumination_interior]`. openOMSI takes as many as you list, up to 63 per mesh. Write the
extra lamp numbers on the lines right after the first four; a blank line ends the list:

```
[mesh]
saloon.o3d

[illumination_interior]
0
1
2
3
4
5
6
7

[matl]
...
```

OMSI 2 reads the first four and skips the rest. A model may declare any number of
`[interiorlight]` lamps, and each mesh names the ones that light it. The same goes for
`[illumination_interior]` in `passengercabin.cfg`.

## Textures of any resolution

- Textures up to 16384 × 16384 pixels load: DDS (DXT1/3/5, uncompressed), TGA, BMP, PNG and
  JPG. Where the graphics card cannot take that size, the texture is halved until it fits.
- There is no 2 GB address-space limit: openOMSI is a 64-bit program.
- A texture keeps its full resolution within 150 m of the camera, so a bus's own 4K
  textures always stay sharp. Far scenery gives up detail only when the texture memory
  (`texture_memory` in the settings, or `OMSI_TEXTURE_MEMORY`, in MB) runs out, as OMSI's
  `[texmemlimit]` does.
- `[scripttexture]`, `[htmltexture]` and `[texttexture]` / `[texttexture_enh]` can be any size the card
  takes.

## PBR materials

Normal, roughness, metalness and occlusion maps beside a texture, up to 4096 × 4096. See
[PBR materials](PBR.md).

## Lights

- Each 25 m square of the world draws up to 32 point and spot lights at once (the nearest
  first), so depots, stations and lit interiors keep their lamps.
- Interior lamps of vehicles are drawn per pixel, with no count limit per vehicle.
- `[spotlight_2]` in the `model.cfg` is a spotlight of its own: low beam, main beam, fog
  lamps or a lamp over a door can light the road at the same time, each switched by its
  variable, beside the one `[spotlight]` that `Spot_Select` picks. It takes the twelve
  numbers of a `[spotlight]` (position, direction, red, green, blue, range, inner and
  outer cone angle), then the variable (0 off, 1 full, in between dimmed; a number is a
  constant) and a flag:

  ```
  [spotlight_2]
  0.95
  5.95
  0.652
  0
  1
  -0.3
  255
  255
  233
  200
  30
  80
  lights_fern
  0
  ```

  With the flag 0 (or left out) the lamp is where it says and a twin of it stands on the
  other side of the vehicle, mirrored across its axis (x and the x of the direction turned
  round): put the position on one headlamp. With 1 there is just the one lamp, for a
  light over a door or a cornering lamp. In the enhanced picture at night, the player's lamps
  that shine along the road cast the shadows of what stands in front of them (one shadow map
  for all of them), and a lamp with the flag 1 - one without a mirrored twin, up to four on
  the vehicle - has a shadow map of its own, the vehicle's body among its casters: a lamp over a
  door is shaded by the roof edge, the door frame and the people on the steps. A pair is as bright as a `[spotlight]` of the same
  colour, shared between its two lamps. The position is used as written: unlike a
  `[spotlight]`'s, it is not moved onto the vehicle's front. A rear section's model may have
  its own; their variables are the bus's.

## LED glow: set by hand, per material

In the enhanced picture a material can glow like the dots of an LED destination panel: its lit
parts burn above their colour and the glow draws a halo around them. Nothing is guessed from the
material any more - a `\S:n` script mask does not make a panel glow by itself. Give the material the
key `[led_glow_effect]` and a number from 0 to 1 on the next line, inside its `[matl]` block:

```
[matl]
vmatrix_led.bmp
0
[matl_transmap]
\S:1
[matl_lightmap]
vmatrix_leer_led_LM.png
elec_busbar_main
[led_glow_effect]
1
```

- `0` keeps the glow off the material; `1` is a panel at the strength of the player's *LED glow*
  setting; a number between scales that strength and the halo with it. The halo is strong - a
  large surface is best given 0.1-0.4.
- Without the key the material does not glow, whatever it carries. This is a change from earlier
  versions, where every `\S:n` panel with a white light map glowed: add the key to a panel that
  should.
- It works on any material of a vehicle or a scenery object, not only on a script's display. A
  material with a `[matl_lightmap]` glows where its light map is lit (and its variable switches
  it); one with only a `[matl_nightmap]` glows by the night map, at night or when the night map is
  switched on; with neither, all over, in the colour of its texture.
- A material with a `\S:n` transmap keeps its dots sharp as the *LED mip strength* setting says.
  A material without one is filtered as usual.
- The glow follows the player's *LED glow* setting (0 = off for every material), and a
  `[matl_item]` takes the key of its base material unless it has its own.
- OMSI 2 ignores the key.

## Screens: static cameras

`[add_camera_reflexion_static]` in the `.bus` adds a camera for a screen - a CCTV monitor
of the doors, a reversing camera - to the mirrors. It takes the numbers of an
`[add_camera_reflexion]` (x, y, z, distance, field of view, yaw, pitch) and counts with the
mirrors: camera N draws into the texture `reflexionN.bmp`. Unlike a mirror's, its picture
does not move with the driver's head: it looks along its yaw (degrees clockwise from the
vehicle's forward) and pitch (up), as a driver camera does. Its picture is what it sees,
not a mirror image, so map the screen's texture the right way round.

The reflection cameras of an articulated bus's rear sections count on from those of the
section in front: with mirrors 0 to 3 in the front section's `.bus`, a camera in the rear
section's `.bus` is number 4, and a screen in the cab showing `reflexion4.bmp` shows what
that camera sees from the rear section.

## Models

- `.o3d` files with 32-bit indices (the long-index flag) are drawn with their full vertex
  and face count; everything is drawn with 32-bit indices.
- There is no limit on the number of meshes, materials, `[matl_change]` items, `[CTC]`
  entries, cameras, doors, passenger places, wheels or axles.

## Passenger doors: sixteen entries and sixteen exits

OMSI 2 has the door variables of eight `[entry]` and eight `[exit]` paths a vehicle
(`PAX_Entry0_Open` to `PAX_Entry7_Open`, the same with `_Req` and for `PAX_Exit`). openOMSI
has them for sixteen of each: `PAX_Entry8_Open` ... `PAX_Entry15_Open`, `PAX_Entry8_Req` ...
and the same for the exits. An entry or exit past the eighth is a door of its own once the
script sets its `_Open` variable (or lists it in a varlist); then its passengers wait for that
variable and ask for the door through its own `_Req`. Without it, it opens with the eighth, as
in OMSI 2. Its passengers' requests then go through the eighth's `_Req` in openOMSI, while
OMSI 2 loses them (its request arrays have eight slots).

openOMSI also tells the script who stands in a doorway: `PAX_Entry<n>_Busy` and
`PAX_Exit<n>_Busy` (n 0 to 15) are 1 while somebody is on the door's threshold or in the
opening between it and the step outside - what a door's light barrier sees - and 0 otherwise;
the people queueing outside a shut door, in the aisle or on the deck above do not count. A
door script can keep a door open or open it again while its `_Busy` is set. Like the `_Req`,
they are written before the scripts run every frame and cleared after them; a door past the
eighth without variables of its own reports through the eighth's. OMSI 2 does not have them.

## Passenger places switched by the script

OMSI 2's `[passpos]` places are all there all the time. In openOMSI a `[passpos]` may name a
script variable on the line straight after its five values: while that variable is 0 no
passenger takes the place (whoever sits there already stays until they get off), so a bus
can have two seating layouts and switch between them with a setvar. A second name on the
line after that is a variable the engine sets to 1 while somebody is on the place and to 0
while nobody is - a tip-up seat can fold down for the person on it - without the seat
numbers `GetHumanCountOnSeat` needs:

```
[passpos]
0.94
0.04
0.92
0.43
0
layout_transverse
seat_12_taken
```

Both are ordinary variables of the bus's varlists. A place without the lines, or with a
name the scripts do not have, is always there; a blank line or the next block ends the
list, and OMSI 2 passes over the lines.

## Ticket validators: one by every door

OMSI 2 uses one `[stamper]` of a `passengercabin.cfg`, the last one written. openOMSI keeps
every `[stamper]` of every section, and a passenger with a ticket to stamp uses the one
nearest the door they came in by. Write one `[stamper]` block per validator (path point,
then x, y, z of the device, as usual); OMSI 2 still takes the last of them.

## Scripts and plugins

- Script variables and string variables have no count limit.
- Lua plugins can read and write script variables, fire triggers and react to game events:
  see [Plugins](PLUGINS.md).

## Radio: a map's stations and a bus's display

What a player sees and hears is in the [user guide](USER_GUIDE.md#radio); here is what a map
or a bus can add. Omsi.exe reads none of it, so a map or bus made for both games loses
nothing in OMSI 2.

**A map's own stations.** `radio.cfg` beside the map's `global.cfg`, written like the
player's (`name = address` a line). Its stations come first on the station buttons while the
map is driven, the player's follow (one with the same address as a map's is left out). Its `volume`
line is not read: loudness stays the player's business. The file is read again when another
map is loaded.

**Frequencies.** Behind the address may stand the frequencies the station is on, for radios
that show one: `| 94.6` is the station's frequency everywhere, `| 94.6 @ x, y` the one near
that place of the map. A station may have as many as it has transmitters along the route:

```
# name = address | frequency @ x, y | ...
Radiozurnal = https://rozhlas.stream/radiozurnal.mp3 | 94.6 @ 25500, 20000 | 90.9 @ 2307, -717
Regional    = https://example.org/regional.mp3 | 97.9
```

`x, y` are the game's metres: the tile's column and row times 300 m plus the place within
the tile. The easiest way to get them is the log: `spawned at entry point 38 "Chlum,hl.sil."
(12810.6, 3735.5, 60.3)` when a bus is put on the map, or an entry point's own numbers in
`global.cfg` (`[entrypoints]`: the place in the tile, then the tile's index into `[map]`).
The place nearest to the bus decides which frequency is shown; there is no blending, so one
place per town along the route is enough. A map's places are map positions, not
coordinates on the globe: many maps shorten and bend their routes.

**A bus's display.** A radio script that wants the station and the song in its display
declares the string variable `Snd_Radio_Text` (in a `[stringvarnamelist]` file of the bus)
and shows it in a text texture: openOMSI writes the text there, ten characters, a longer
text running through, while the radio plays. The variables the radio itself sets are those
of OMSI's radio plugins - `Snd_Radio` (1 while a cassette or the radio plays: the first
station), or `SndExt_Radio` (the station button, 0 = off) with `SndVol_Radio` (the volume,
0..1, up to 2). Dmitrij's "Magnitola" is served as it comes: while it shows its track,
its `magnitola_1` (`frequency@station`, `@` the line break) gets the map's frequency for the
place in its first line and the station and song in its second.

## What stays as in OMSI 2

The following behave as in OMSI 2 so that existing content works unchanged:

- the script stack (8 values) and registers (`l0`-`l9`, `s0`-`s9`);
- one `[spotlight]` lit at a time per vehicle (the one `Spot_Select` picks; `[spotlight_2]`,
  above, adds more);
- 100 particles per emitter.

In a LAN session, other players see up to 7 doors, 15 wheels and 127 lamps of a vehicle.
