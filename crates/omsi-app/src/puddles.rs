//! Tyre spray on wet roads: what every vehicle's wheels throw up from the water on the road.
//! The puddle itself - the glass-flat, reflective patches on a wet `[moisture]` road, with
//! the raindrop ripples crossing it - is the renderer's (`road_puddle_coverage` in
//! `shader.wgsl`, shared by Enhanced); this file only works out *where* one lies (the same
//! mask, evaluated here so a tyre can be asked whether it stands in one) and makes the
//! spray, drawn as the renderer's smoke particles: soft, lit by the scene, blended.
//!
//! What a tyre does with water is what the spray does here. The tread lifts the water at the
//! back of the contact patch and flings it backwards and up; the heavier part comes down
//! again within a metre or two (a fan behind each wheel, the sheets going a little
//! outwards), the rest breaks up into a fine mist that the vehicle's wake drags along for a
//! moment and then leaves hanging behind it, where it drifts with the air, spreads and
//! slowly settles. All of it grows with the square of the speed - next to nothing at walking
//! pace, a cloud at 50 km/h and more - and with the water there is: standing water throws
//! by far the most, a road that is merely wet through only a thin haze at speed, and a bus
//! or a lorry throws more than a car. A tyre that hits a puddle hard adds a short splash out
//! to the side.
//!
//! Some vehicles spray through their own `[smoke]` systems as well, at their wheels, fed by
//! `tire_wet_freq` / `tire_wet_live`: the stock AI cars (set by their `main_AI` scripts) and
//! the stock SD200, SD202 and NL/NG buses, the AI SD84 among them (set by their `spray.osc`),
//! only once the road is wet through (`StreetCond` 1). Those keep spraying as OMSI has them;
//! such a vehicle gets no haze of its own here on the wet road (that is what its `[smoke]`
//! draws), only what standing water throws, which OMSI knows nothing of, on top.
