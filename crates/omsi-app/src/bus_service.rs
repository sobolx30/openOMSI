//! Timetable buses as traffic. A timetable bus is one of the town's AI cars (`AiCar`,
//! created by the same `Traffic::create_car` as every other car, driven by the same

//! the stops of its trip, the pull into the bay, the doors at each stop, the wait for the
//! departure time, the blinker and the pull back out, the end of the trip, and the people
//! aboard. Nothing of the player's bus is involved: no driver inputs, no throttle and brake
//! for the script to turn into motion - the car moves, the script only animates it.
