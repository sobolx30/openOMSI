//! Runtime for a sound configuration attached to an object with script variables.
//!
//! Everything here follows Omsi.exe's `TSound` update (0x750340, 2.2.032), which plays each
//! entry through its own DirectSound buffer:
//!
//! * volume = the entry's volume x every `[volcurve]` (linear between `[pnt]`s, held at the
//!   ends), x `min(range / distance, 1)` for a `[3d]` sound, x `0.2 + Snd_OutsideVol` for an
//!   AI vehicle while the camera is in a cab, x `Snd_OutsideVol` for the own bus's outside
//!   sounds heard in the cab - as a linear amplitude, turned into hundredths of a dB
//!   (`2000 * log10`) for `SetVolume`: over 0 dB or under -100 dB the call is refused and the
//!   buffer keeps the volume it had, at -100 dB or below the sound is not started;
//! * pitch = a `[loopsound]`'s `rate * |variable| / reference` for `SetFrequency` (refused
//!   outside DirectSound's 100 to 200 000 Hz; not started below 100 Hz); a `[sound]` plays
//!   at its file's rate;
//! * a `[3d]` sound is panned by at most `50 * [sound_stereo]` hundredths of a dB (see
//!   `mixer::pan_gains`), nothing else is spatial: a sound without `[3d]` is heard at the
//!   same level wherever the listener is - on an AI vehicle too.
